# Airbitz Whitelabel

Some old Airbitz customers sill remember their PIN, but can no long log in because Airbitz doesn't work anymore. We need to release a new Airbitz version into the app stores with working login, giving these users a way to recover their funds.

This project is largely based on the edge-login-ui-rn readme instructions, plus a simple post-login screen with a few recovery options.
